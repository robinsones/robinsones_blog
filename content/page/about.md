I work at DataCamp as a Data Scientist on the experimentation team, where I built and run their experimentation analytics system. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. I regularly give talks on A/B testing and R programming at conferences and meetups (see all talks [here](https://hookedondata.org/speaking/)). I'm also an author of the upcoming book, [Build Your Career in Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/build-your-career-in-data-science?a_aid=buildcareer&a_bid=76784b6a),with [Jacqueline Nolis](https://jnolis.com/), to be published by Manning in early 2020. You can pre-order it and get 40% off with the code buildbook40%. 

I hold a Master's degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior) from INSEAD. I also earned my bachelor's degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions. 

I love all animals and consider myself part of the [#rcatladies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rcatladies) despite not owning a cat. I do have a part-time dog, Abby, who I steal from my parents occasionally.
