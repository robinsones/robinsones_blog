      <title>An Introduction to Tidyverts: Time Series and Forecasting in R</title>

      <description>I recently moved to a new position at Warby Parker as a senior data scientist. Although I’ve loved working on A/B testing and continue to do so, one of the things that drew me to this position was the chance to try out different areas of data science. And that opportunity came early, as one of my first projects has been working on time series and forecasting.
While I’ve been programming in R for 9 years now and minored in statistics, I had actually never done any time series analysis in courses or at work.</description>

      <description>I recently completed Colin Fay’s excellent DataCamp course, Intermediate Functional Programming with purrr (full disclosure: I work at DataCamp, but part of why I joined was that I was a big fan of the short, interactive course format). Although I’ve used the purrr package before, there were a lot of functions in this course that were new to me. I wrote this post to hopefully demystify purrr a bit for those who find it overwhelming and illustrate some of its lesser known functions.</description>

      <description>In early 2018, I gave a few conference talks on “The Lesser Known Stars of the Tidyverse.” I focused on some packages and functions that aren’t as well known as the core parts of ggplot2 and dplyr but are very helpful in exploratory analysis. I walked through an example analysis of Kaggle’s 2017 State of Data Science and Machine Learning Survey to show how I would use these functions in an exploratory analysis.</description>
