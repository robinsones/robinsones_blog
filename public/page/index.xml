      <description>I work at DataCamp as a Data Scientist on the growth team. Previously, I was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. I regularly give talks on A/B testing and R programming at conferences and meetups; if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in having me speak at your event, please email at emily[at]datacamp.com. You can see a list of all my past talks, including links to recordings where available, here.</description>
