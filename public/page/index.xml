      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a data science freelancer, primarily as an expert witness on a trade secrets case. Previously, I worked at Warby Parker as a senior data scientist on a centralized team tackling some of the company&amp;rsquo;s biggest projects, including redesigning their experimentation platform and training and deploying machine learning models; at DataCamp, where I built and ran their experimentation analytics system; and at Etsy, where I worked with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments.</description>

      <description>I regularly give talks on A/B Testing, programming in R, data science career advice, and more. I&amp;rsquo;ve given talks across the country and internationally, to audiences ranging from 25 people to 800. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in having me speak at your event, please contact me at robinson.es[at]gmail.com
My co-author Jacqueline Nolis and I also have our own podcast based on our book of the same title, Build a Career in Data Science.</description>
