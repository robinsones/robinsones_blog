      <description>I work at DataCamp as a Data Scientist on the experimentation team, where I built and run their experimentation analytics system. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. I regularly give talks on A/B testing and R programming at conferences and meetups (see all talks here). I&amp;rsquo;m also an author of the upcoming book, Build Your Career in Data Science,with Jacqueline Nolis, to be published by Manning in early 2020.</description>
