      <description>I work at Warby Parker as a senior data scientist on a centralized team tackling some of the company&amp;rsquo;s biggest projects. Previously I was at DataCamp, where I built and ran their experimentation analytics system, and at Etsy, where I worked with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments. I regularly give talks on A/B testing, R programming, and data science career advice at conferences and meetups (see all talks here).</description>
