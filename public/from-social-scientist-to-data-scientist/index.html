<p>I learned a lot in my two years at INSEAD getting a master’s in Organizational Behavior. Many of the skills and knowledge I gained there will be beneficial as a data scientist, from defining a problem to carrying out a thoughtful analysis to communicating to a range of audiences. But one skill I wasn’t developing was working in an industry-level coding environment.</p>
<p>This hit home one day this spring. In one of my classes, we had been writing code in STATA. The professor wanted us to be able to see the code the other students had written, so, naturally, he suggested we do it through a shared dropbox folder. I don’t think he had ever heard of Github, let alone tried to use it.</p>
<p>This was one of the downsides of being in stand-alone business school, especially one in a small foreign town. We didn’t have a Statistics or Computer Science program, and there was no community of programmers outside the school either. A few PhD students did use Python extensively in their research, and two of them even put together a 2-day beginner Python workshop for professor and PhD students. On the first day, the student teacher showed how you could use pygeocoder to get the location of a list of universities. A professor sitting in on the class exclaimed, “I’ve spent five hours doing that before!” While learning programming at INSEAD is becoming more common and encouraged, almost all of it was still self-taught, with no best practices, formal curriculum, or expert professors available.</p>
<div id="starting-off-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Starting off in R</h2>
<p>I was fortunate to attend Rice University and take classes from and designed by Hadley Wickham, the most prominent developer of packages for R (he has even been referred to as <a href="http://priceonomics.com/hadley-wickham-the-man-who-revolutionized-r/">the man who revolutionized R</a>). I didn’t fully appreciate the amazing opportunity I was receiving at that time, despite my brother David telling me how jealous he was that I personally knew the great Hadley Wickham. Now David has gotten to know Hadley as well through his creation of the <a href="https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom">broom package</a>, which tidies the output of R functions like linear regression and t-tests into dataframes. Broom has now even become a core part of the what Hadley would like us to call “the tidyverse” (instead of the “<a href="http://adolfoalvarez.cl/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-hadleyverse/">Hadleyverse</a>,” as is the current practice). But at least I can always still say I knew Hadley first.</p>
<p>Taking course designed by Hadley means that I’ve been programming in R for almost five years. I also took the introduction to computer science course, which used Python, but I never really kept up with it. While I still have a lot to learn in R, especially <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r">functional programming</a>, I feel comfortable working with and growing in the “tidyverse.”</p>
<p>The same could not be said for Python. I took some <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science">online courses</a>, but mostly I just continued using R. I decided what I needed was an immersive experience where I could work with Python while learning machine learning, web scraping, D3, cloud computing, and more. Coding bootcamps have proliferated over the last few years, with <a href="https://www.coursereport.com">whole websites</a> dedicated to helping people chose one. <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com">Metis’s</a> data science bootcamp is a 12-week program that helps students transition into a career as a data scientist, and it seemed like the perfect environment for me.</p>
</div>
<div id="metis-so-far" class="section level2">
<h2>Metis So Far</h2>
<p>Well, it’s one week and one day in, and so far it’s been a great experience. The group of 25 students is amazingly diverse. Experience ranges from one year out of school to 15 or even 20 years in industry. Some people have mathematics or computer science degrees, a few have PhDs, while others learned to code mostly on their own. Each day we start off with 45 minutes of pair programming. We’re randomly assigned to a different person each day, so one day I can be guiding someone through accessing elements of a pandas dataframe and the other day learning the tricks of Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>I’m excited to continue my journey at Metis over the next few months. I am certain I’ll never have to be worried about being bored!</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I recently started playing Pokémon again - “Pokémon Let’s Go Eevee” on the Nintendo Switch to be specific. In the classic Pokémon games, you have a team of 6 Pokémon that you use to battle against other trainers. In battles, type match-ups are very important, as some types of moves are “super effective” against other types. For example, fire moves are super effective against grass Pokémon, which means they do double the damage they normally would.</div>

I analyze a dataset on Bob Ross paintings from last week’s Tidytuesday, an initiative by the R for Data Science online learning community. Each Monday, a new dataset is posted on GitHub with a short description. You can see some analyses and visualizations people have done by searching for the #tidytuesday hashtag on Twitter.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I recently completed Colin Fay’s excellent DataCamp course, Intermediate Functional Programming with purrr (full disclosure: I work at DataCamp, but part of why I joined was that I was a big fan of the short, interactive course format). Although I’ve used the purrr package before, there were a lot of functions in this course that were new to me. I wrote this post to hopefully demystify purrr a bit for those who find it overwhelming and illustrate some of its lesser known functions.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">In early 2018, I gave a few conference talks on “The Lesser Known Stars of the Tidyverse.” I focused on some packages and functions that aren’t as well known as the core parts of ggplot2 and dplyr but are very helpful in exploratory analysis. I walked through an example analysis of Kaggle’s 2017 State of Data Science and Machine Learning Survey to show how I would use these functions in an exploratory analysis.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">When I was working at Etsy, I benefited from a very robust A/B testing system. Etsy had been doing A/B testing for more than 6 years. By the time I left, Etsy’s in-house experimentation system, called Catapult, had more than 5 data engineers working on it full-time. Every morning, I was greeted with a homepage that listed all the experiments that Etsy had run in the prior four years. When you clicked on one, you got a summary of what the experiment was testing (usually written by the product manager).</div>

When interviewing for any position, you should be evaluating the company just as much as they are evaluating you. While you can research the company beforehand on glassdoor and similar sites, interviews are the best place to get a deeper understanding of the company and ask important questions.</div>

Many of these principles also apply to tech jobs in general.

What is sponsorship? When people discuss what they’re seeking from a more senior person in their field, they usually talk about “mentorship.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">So you’ve heard you’re supposed to network. That’s the key in getting a job or establishing a reputation in your broader field, right? And it’s true that the importance of having a good network is supported by a lot of social sciences research. But if the thought of networking makes you cringe, you’re not alone. Many people equate networking to sending out millions of unsolicited Linkedin requests with no message, handing out 20 business cards at a meetup once a week, or sending emails to prominent data scientists with the subject line “Can I pick your brain?</div>
