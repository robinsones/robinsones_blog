      <description>When my co-author Jacqueline Nolis and I wrote our book, Build a Career in Data Science, we wanted to provide a comprehensive resource of the non-technical skills and knowledge needed to get into and succeed in data science. I’ve been really pleased with the positive feedback we’ve gotten from the people it and our free companion podcast has helped. But while I think most people will find something new and helpful in it, one book can never be the only word on a topic as broad as career advice.</description>

      <description>[This is my final post on publishing a technical book. If you’re wondering if you should write one, how to find a publisher, or what the writing process is like, start from the beginning.]
It’s really cool to have a physical copy of something you wrote! I still sometimes just flip through the pages, marveling at how professional it looks and how much content we created. The final book ended up being 350 pages, so although it’s no mammoth technical reference, you can certainly spot it on your bookshelf.</description>

      <description>[This is my third post on publishing a technical book. Check out the previous posts on why you should (and shouldn’t) write a book and how to find a publisher.]
Finding the time Overall I’d estimate writing the book, including the proposal process, took us each around 400 hours over a year and a half. This doesn’t count the work promoting the book after it was out, which I’ll talk about in part 4.</description>

      <description>[This is my second post on publishing a technical book. If you’re not sure if you should write a book, check out part 1.]
You’ve probably heard of some book publishers before like Simon and Schuster or Random House. Those companies don’t usually get involved in smaller technical books. Instead there are several specialized publishers for books in the tech field; the biggest are O’Reilly, Manning, Pearson, and Chapman and Hall, along with some specialized ones like A Book Apart (which publishes short books).</description>

      <description>Following the sage wisdom of brother Dave to write a blog post when you’ve given the same advice three times, after I had a few people reach out to me with questions about writing a technical book, I’ve put together my thoughts in this four-part series a year after publishing Build a Career in Data Science with Jacqueline Nolis.
In April 2018, Jacqueline reached out to me about whether I would be interested in writing a book.</description>

      <description>I recently started playing Pokémon again - “Pokémon Let’s Go Eevee” on the Nintendo Switch to be specific. In the classic Pokémon games, you have a team of 6 Pokémon that you use to battle against other trainers. In battles, type match-ups are very important, as some types of moves are “super effective” against other types. For example, fire moves are super effective against grass Pokémon, which means they do double the damage they normally would.</description>

      <description>In this post, I try something new and share an analysis I did without stopping to explain the code along the way (with a few exceptions). I analyze a dataset on Bob Ross paintings from last week’s Tidytuesday, an initiative by the R for Data Science online learning community. Each Monday, a new dataset is posted on GitHub with a short description. You can see some analyses and visualizations people have done by searching for the #tidytuesday hashtag on Twitter.</description>

      <description>Have you ever had a “first this then that” question? For example, maybe you’re an e-commerce business and you want all the times people clicked on an item and then added it to their cart within 2 days, or the last page they visited before registering. Or you work with pharmaceutical data and need to know what drugs people took before drug x and which drugs they took afterward and when.</description>

      <description>I recently completed Colin Fay’s excellent DataCamp course, Intermediate Functional Programming with purrr (full disclosure: I work at DataCamp, but part of why I joined was that I was a big fan of the short, interactive course format). Although I’ve used the purrr package before, there were a lot of functions in this course that were new to me. I wrote this post to hopefully demystify purrr a bit for those who find it overwhelming and illustrate some of its lesser known functions.</description>

      <description>In early 2018, I gave a few conference talks on “The Lesser Known Stars of the Tidyverse.” I focused on some packages and functions that aren’t as well known as the core parts of ggplot2 and dplyr but are very helpful in exploratory analysis. I walked through an example analysis of Kaggle’s 2017 State of Data Science and Machine Learning Survey to show how I would use these functions in an exploratory analysis.</description>

      <description>When I was working at Etsy, I benefited from a very robust A/B testing system. Etsy had been doing A/B testing for more than 6 years. By the time I left, Etsy’s in-house experimentation system, called Catapult, had more than 5 data engineers working on it full-time. Every morning, I was greeted with a homepage that listed all the experiments that Etsy had run in the prior four years. When you clicked on one, you got a summary of what the experiment was testing (usually written by the product manager).</description>

When interviewing for any position, you should be evaluating the company just as much as they are evaluating you. While you can research the company beforehand on glassdoor and similar sites, interviews are the best place to get a deeper understanding of the company and ask important questions.</description>

      <description>Following Dave Robinson’s sage tweet to write a blog post when you’ve given the same advice three times, this post is a collection of my thoughts and recommendations for people interested in applying to data science jobs in the US. Many of these principles also apply to tech jobs in general.
A disclaimer: I have never worked as a recruiter or career coach. This knowledge comes from mainly from my study of Organizational Behavior (including negotiations and women in tech) in graduate school and my own career.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I discussed the importance of building your network and some strategies for effectively reaching out. I closed with emphasizing how helpful your peers or people one step ahead of you can be. But there’s a specific area where people with more resources, status, or experience can help you: sponsorship.
What is sponsorship? When people discuss what they’re seeking from a more senior person in their field, they usually talk about “mentorship.</description>

      <description>So you’ve heard you’re supposed to network. That’s the key in getting a job or establishing a reputation in your broader field, right? And it’s true that the importance of having a good network is supported by a lot of social sciences research. But if the thought of networking makes you cringe, you’re not alone. Many people equate networking to sending out millions of unsolicited Linkedin requests with no message, handing out 20 business cards at a meetup once a week, or sending emails to prominent data scientists with the subject line “Can I pick your brain?</description>

      <description>In the other part of this post, I covered how to start becoming involved in the data science community and meet people in general. But what if you read a really cool post by someone and want to follow up with them? This post offers some thoughts on how you can most effectively reach out to specific people.
Two important caveats to start, both inspired by other posts on similar topics.</description>

In this post, I wanted to share some suggestions for managing business challenges that I didn’t have time to cover in my talk.
Why Business Challenges? Why devote a whole post and half a talk to business challenges instead of, say, cutting edge deep learning papers or the shiny new language for handling Big DataTM?</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I gave my first ever data science talk. Jared Lander, organizer of the New York Statistical Open Programming meetup, had been asking me to speak, and after about six months at Etsy I thought I could share what I’d learned about A/B Testing and its challenges. If you’d like to watch it, you can view the recording here. The talk starts around 9:00 and ends at 41:30, with the rest being Q&amp;amp;A (I tried to repeat the questions, so you should be able to follow that as well).</description>

      <description>Last week I spent four amazing days in Orlando at the first ever rstudio::conf. I learned a ton, met some really cool people, connected with several I hadn’t seen in a while, and came out feeling ready to take on the world.
I’ve divided my summary of the conference into two parts. This first one shares my personal experience and some more general learnings, while the other one has quick, bullet-pointed lists on writing functions, packages, tools, and functions I learned, and general tips and tricks.</description>

      <description>When Donald Trump first entered the Republican presidential primary on June 16, 2015, no media outlet seemed to take him seriously as a contender. He is a highly unusual candidate, and some in the media have admitted that they, and the media more generally, don’t know how to cover him, both in the primary and now in the general election. Trump himself has criticized the media’s coverage of him:</description>

      <description>The Bright Blue Horror Coming into Metis, I knew one of the hardest parts would be switching from R to Python. Beyond simply having much more experience in R, I had come to rely on Hadley Wickham’s fantastic set of R packages for data science. One of these is ggplot2, a data visualization package. While there is a version of ggplot2 for python, I decided to learn the main plotting system in Python, matplotlib.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post, I was fortunate to enter graduate school with a few years of programming experience in R. I learned R exclusively through my Statistics classes; while I took the graduate-level psychology statistics course at Rice and was a research assistant in multiple departments, all used SPSS.
As this discrepancy suggests, the social sciences are often lagging behind in teaching and using open-source software. Fortunately, there is some effort to change this.</description>

      <description>I learned a lot in my two years at INSEAD getting a master’s in Organizational Behavior. Many of the skills and knowledge I gained there will be beneficial as a data scientist, from defining a problem to carrying out a thoughtful analysis to communicating to a range of audiences. But one skill I wasn’t developing was working in an industry-level coding environment.
This hit home one day this spring. In one of my classes, we had been writing code in STATA.</description>
